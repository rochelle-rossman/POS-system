# POS System

Welcome to the POS-system for Hip-Hop, PZA, & Wangs, a web-based point of sale application for managing sales transactions. With POS-system, authenticated users can create and edit products, process orders, and view sales reports.

This project was built as a group project while attending Nashville Software School.
We were provided with a  **[wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/4y3EZddALuBR3ouSEM57Np/MVP?node-id=0%3A1)** and MVP requirements to achieve in a single sprint. 

##

As a team we:
* Created an **ERD** to show the relationships between all of our data
* Created a **Postman Collection** to store and test out all of our API calls.
* **Flowchart** - Planned out the flow of our data through the application
* **Github Issue Tickets** - Using the Project Instructions as a guide, created issue tickets for this projectâ€™s work.
* **Github Milestones** - Separated those issue tickets into Milestones to plan out the work.
* **Github Project Board** - Created a project board, added all of our issue tickets, and order them by priority.
* **Version Control** - Used Git/GitHub for version control and team work flow by using the branch model.
